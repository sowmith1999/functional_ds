# Functional DataStructures
Repo for 2023 Summer Directed Readings at UAB under Dr. Thomas Gilray - Functional DataStructures

## Introduction
This repo is to include all the code & reports made for the course. Topic is Functional DataStructures, review of foundational and important data structures in the functional world. Goal is to implement a some of them with and without persistence and understand the differences. The following are the data structures that are included ->
- [Linked List](./src/linked_list/ll_notes.md) {In Progress}
- Binary Tree [Pending]
- Red Black Tree [Pending]

## Misc Notes
- Each data structure worked on gets a folder.
-  each src folder inside the top folder is to be a implementation of the data structure indicated by the folder name.
- Idea is to have some report/content written about the data structure and the implementation, interface and features included and left out and some conclusion notes.
