# Binary Tree

- It has the head node
- number of elements in the tree
- height of the tree

## Node
- Each binary tree node contains three elements : data, left pointer and right pointer.
- Left pointer and right pointer each point to nodes themselves.

## Operations on Binary tree
- Inserting an element
- Removing an element
- Searching an element
- Traversing the tree


## Iterator
- We need a new class for the iterator
- we will get a pointer that we add ++ and -- operators that basically move the iterator pointer forward and backward in the data structure.
- we will have the begin and end function, which will return the pointer to the first value and one past the last value respectively.
